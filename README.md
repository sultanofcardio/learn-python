# Learn Python

This repository is my attempt to teach a noob how to code. I've never done this before, and even though I'm fairly confident in my ability to write code and develop software, I believe a true test of one's expertise is in his ability to inculcate his knowledge in others.

I'm actually making this up as I go along, and I'm making this repository public for two reasons:

1. As an attempt to keep myself honest in this pursuit
2. In case this actually turns out to be something useful and someone else can benefit from this

Let's see where this goes.
