## Introduction

So you wanted to learn how to program. 

I'm not sure why you decided to do this but I happen to know how to write code in some languages 
and make programs so I guess I could teach you some things.

People have always told me that as a noob, Python is a great first language when getting your feet 
wet with programming.

I don't have any strong reservations about this recommendation so I'm going to use Python for this 
endeavour - if only because there's lots of material out there on the language.

## Not So Fast

I don't think you came here to learn how to program without first knowing what the
heck programming even is. Nevertheless, I'm going to cover all my bases.

> In a nutshell, programming is the method by which humans tell computers what to 
>do.

Oh - what is a computer you ask? Great question. Now we're getting to the meat of the matter.

### The What

> A computer is a device for storing and processing data

Yes.

### The How

How a computer actually works is vital knowledge to a programmer. So let's talk 
about that.

For storing data, a computer uses various kinds of storage devices. These can be
what we call primary storage aka Random Access Memory (RAM), or 
secondary storage like your hard drive or SSD. We don't need to worry so much about this.

Primary storage is so-called because it is directly accessible from the computer's
Central Processing Unit (CPU) - a device that executes **instructions** in the computer.
You see computers at their core are just things that can do other things very well. What other things? 
It depends on the CPU.

Luckily for us, CPUs come with very clear instructions - in what is known as an **instruction set**. So we 
happen to know exactly how to tell it what to do, and it is these instructions that determine what things the 
CPU is capable of doing.

## Remarks

Of course I've glossed over some things and left out some others, but I think it's necessary to stay focused
on what's really important. I hope I've given you at least a basic appreciation for what is happening
at the heart of the device you're using to read this document.

Ok cool. Let's talk about programming.
